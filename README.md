When first start the app, the user will be asked to login. You can use your existed account to login, or click on the register button to register a new account.

When registering, the user has to click on the dummy profile image to upload a png image file (<5MB) to use as their profile image. After filling in all the fields, the account will be sussessfully created and the user will be re-directed to the login/register page.

After logging in, click on "EXPLORE EVENTS" to start the journey of EventMe!

In the Explore fragment, the user will be able to search/sort/interact with events. In the Map fragment, the user can use the map and interact with the event markers. In the Fav Fragment, the user can interact with the events they marked as favorite. In the Profile fragment, the user will be able to view their profile and registered events.

If the user chooses not to log in, they will be able to use the app in geust mode, in which they won't be able to view the profile or register/fav events.

Side Notes:
1. When first starting the emulator, make sure to change the current location to somewhere in LA, so that you won't need to drag all the way from a random spot to LA to view the markers.
2. If the images cannot be loaded (with extremely low probability, since we have tested it thoroughly), wipe the data of your emulator and try again.
3. The events "49th Annual Dia de los Muertos Exhibition", "Adaptive Sports Festival 2022", and "An Evening of World Music and Jazz" have time conflicts. In case you want to test this feature :)
